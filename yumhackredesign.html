                    <p>Coming into YumHack, there were preexisting designs and branding. It didn't give me a chance to conduct research with users, but there were a few things that could be improved upon - with User Testing hopefully giving us valuable feedback down the line once we launch the beta.</p>

                    <h2>Menu</h2>
                    <p>Looking at other food apps, I noticed we didn't show food enough. One of the changes I was most excited about what getting rid of the list and thumbnails, and tossing in cards that showed off food, logos, and buttons to help get around.</p>

                    <p>This was originally also another poor list view - with the menu items as the thumbnail.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While I'm still not entirely sure if this is how I want to display the food items, I think I'll keep the addition of the small blurb at the top of every restaurant's page.</p>

                    <p>I still have to figure out what Tablefeed - the first page of the app - is going to look like. I'll most likely go with the sketch at the bottom of the second wireframe.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also have to address the inconsistencies between the three platforms (iOS, Android, Windows). There are certain things - like the way Windows removes the tabbar from the bottom of the toolbar when navigating to other pages - that I feel look better on the app. But I'll leave that decision up to the users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the meantime, I'm looking forward to going out and trying all the secret menu items :) and taking better pictures for the official release while our beta group gives us feedback.</p>
